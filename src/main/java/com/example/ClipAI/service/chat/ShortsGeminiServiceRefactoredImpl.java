//                Generate a 1-minute YouTube Shorts script about %s. The script should: FORMAT REQUIREMENTS: - Maximum 400 words - Write in plain text without quotation marks - No speaker/narrator labels - No timestamps or technical directions - One continuous paragraph - Avoid special characters that could break JSON - Clearly define the topic, ensuring its attention-grabbing and intriguing. - Request a dramatic, suspenseful, and hyperbolic tone for the narrative. - Ask for a shocking or striking opening statement to immediately hook the audience. - Highlight specific details about the subject, such as size, abilities, and unique traits. - Include speculative or mysterious claims to provoke curiosity and engagement. - Emphasize the potential threat or urgency related to the subject. - use example of real incidence related to topic for proff and relevance- Conclude with a strong call to action, encouraging the audience to interact (e.g., comment, share, or like). - Ensure short, impactful sentences are used to maintain a fast-paced, engaging style.      HOOK STRUCTURE: - Headline-worthy Opener->Starts with a striking, fear-inducing statement (A Kodiak Kraken has just been spotted).    Structure-> 1)Introduction: Briefly establishes the subject with a shocking premise (spotting a terrifying creature). 1)Body: Expands on details, describing the creature's unique traits, actions, and potential threats in a sensational manner. 3)Engagement Hook: Ends with a prompt for interaction, motivating readers to engage with the content.            Emphasis on Numbers and Scale->Highlights measurements like (60 feet in size) and (30 feet long tentacles) to emphasize the creatures enormity and power.       Informal and Conversational Tone->Phrases like (If you want to see) and (then just press on) add an approachable, conversational vibe that appeals to a casual audience. - End with an conclusion of whole script or call to action       WRITING STYLE: - Use vivid, sensory language - Keep sentences short and punchy - Include rhetorical questions - Use power words: mysterious, shocking, incredible, hidden, secret - Create tension through pacing - Target 13-25 second reading time        EXAMPLE OUTPUT:     A Kodiak Kraken has just been spotted in the ocean just off the coast of America, and it is absolutely terrifying. An enormous kraken-like creature has been reported completely strangling creatures as big as blue whales and great white sharks to death in a matter of seconds. What makes the Kodiak Kraken so different from a normal kraken is how much more deadly it is. A normal kraken is known for destroying ships and planes near the Bermuda Triangle but usually stays clear of other animals in the ocean. However, the Kodiak Kraken has no mercy. Anything that gets in its way, it sees as a threat, and its survival instincts tell it to kill the threat as fast as possible.This creature has been recorded at around 60 feet in size, with its tentacles recorded at lengths of 30 feet long. This means that this creature can grasp things such as other creatures, boats, and planes from extreme distances, and once its tentacles have a grip, it is almost impossible to escape. This creature is the main suspect for the disappearance of the USS Cyclops, and if it is not put to an end soon, these ocean predators such as sharks and killer whales may go extinct, as they stand no chance against the Kodiak Kraken. If you want to see this creature strangling a great white shark, which is very graphic, but if you want to see it, then just press on share, on more, and then comment, Kodiak Kraken.
